The Emoji Builder is complicated to explain. This site is for making a sentence with Emoji expression. This is published on GitHub.

### The Iyo Shrine

The Iyo Shrine(JA: 伊予神社) is a virtual shrine that you can pick some Omikujis(like a fortune cookie). I license this as AGPL-3.0 so you can get source codes on GitHub. New result candidates are welcome. If you desire, please make a PR at GitHub.
